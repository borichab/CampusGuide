- **Host Interface**: Hosts can initiate and terminate the discovery process.
- **Client View**: Clients can connect and communicate with the host.

#### Managing Connected Clients
The host retains control over the discovery process even when multiple clients are connected. This flexibility allows the host to manage the communication session effectively.

- **Host Managing Clients**
  - Multiple clients can be connected simultaneously.
  - The host can stop and start the discovery process as needed.

- **Broadcasting Messages**
  - After stopping discovery, the host is ready to broadcast messages to all connected clients. If a new client wishes to join, the host can restart the discovery process, ensuring seamless connections.

- **Broadcast Mode**
  - Host is in broadcasting mode, ready to convey information to all connected users.
  - New users can join the session if the host restarts discovery.
